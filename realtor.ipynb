Overall, she was very responsive, easy to work with, and cared a lot about helping us find what we wanted.    \\n\\nWe especially appreciated the amount of effort she put into showing us homes, especially when we were visiting from Seattle.   In particular, she was working her local connections to help us see homes that might soon come onto the market.   She was also helpful in coordinating with local contractors to get some needed work done on the house and helping us (and the seller) remember all of the must dos.\\n\\nWe recommend Ann as a realtor especially for folks who may be considering relocating and want a caring and attentive agent on the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"rating\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m5\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"id\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"a4334910-50ef-4102-90e5-c70f33d4f0d3\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"display_name\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"Matthew\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"year\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"2021\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"location\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"Niwot, CO\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"source_id\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"RDC\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"responsiveness\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m5\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"negotiation_skills\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m5\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"professionalism_communication\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m5\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"market_expertise\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m5\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"link\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0mnull\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"started_timestamp\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"2021-08-28T06:08:58\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"reply\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"null\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m}\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m{\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"comment\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"Ann Mills was a huge help to us when we decided to buy our first home.

Personally, Robert is one of the most friendly and easy going guys I have ever met. He is calm, cool, and collected and it was an absolute joy to be in his company.  n        On a professional level, from day one, he was a consummate professional. He was punctual, knowledgeable, organized, responsive, and very proud and enthusiastic about his profession: He gave great advice and made a very complex and difficult process seem effortless and easy. Robert sold my house literally within DAYS of putting it on the market, and so we didn't have to endure tons of prospective buyers. Robert far exceeded my expectations and was an absolute joy to work with. He is omniscient in his job and saved me a ton of time and made the entire selling of my house, from beginning to end, as easy as it comes. I would not even consider using anybody else to sell my homes in the future: I knew he had a stellar reputation as one of the best realtors out there, but that was a gross understatement.

Your experience in the market saved us from a huge mistake. You helped us realize that the direction we were planning to go would have been a problem for us down the road.  n nWe made an offer eight days ago and closed on the condo today. The only thing that would have made it better would have been for our two schedules to line up so that you could have been there with us for the signing today. I had to leave town early in the morning, and your buyer's agent was able to shoe-horn us in with the title company early enough for me to be there with my son as he bought his first piece of real estate. n  nHe is thrilled, by the way, as you can imagine.

After putting in our offer, Jean said that the owner was getting ready to sign (which never happened). Apparently, she was making it up, as the owners never did sign our offer or send a counter-offer like she said they were going to. Bad communication within the group, and speaking for the owner of a home is never a good idea.

She was on top of every issue every day during the process! Most importantly Terri has extraordinary communication skills in dealing with her clients as well as with other agents enabling us to complete the transaction in a timely manner with a minimum of stress; although the Buyer's agent was sometimes uncooperative and slow to respond.
